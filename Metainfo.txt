Name of Quantlet:  Rough Volatility with Correlated Jumps

Published in:     ''

Description:      'We extend the rough volatility model by Gatheral, Jaisson and Rosenbaum  and allow for jumps in the return process. Prior to modeling, we need to estimate the parameters of our model. Especially, the Hurst exponent of the log-volatility process is of interest. This deviation from standard to fractional Bronian motion seems to explain some the key stylized facts of volatility in financial markets.'
